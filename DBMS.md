### `Data`: 
- Collection of raw, unorganized facts and details like facts, observations, figures, symbols, etc
- Stored in the form of bits and bytes
- It has no significance by itself

### `Information`: 
- It is processed, interrupted, organized, and structured data 
- Extracted from the data by analyzing and interpreting pieces of data 

### `Data vs Information`:
| `Data` | `Information`  |
| :--------:| :------: |
| Collection of facts | Put those facts into context |
| Raw and unorganized | Organized |
| typically come in the form of graphs, numbers, figures, and statistics | Typically presented through words, language, and ideas |
| Doesn't depend on information | Depend on information |
| Insufficient for decision-making | Make decision based on information |
  
### `Database`: 
- It is an electronic place/system where data is stored in a way that it can be easily accessed, managed, and updated
- It is the collection of related data that represent some real-world entities
- If some changes are there in the real-world entities then the same should be reflected in the database
- To make real use of data, we need a Database management system (DBMS)

### `DBMS`: 
- It is a collection of interrelated data and a set of programs to access those data
- The collection of data usually referred to as the database, contains information relevant to an enterprise
- `Primary Goal`: Store and retrieve database information i.e, both convenient and efficient
- It is a database with all the software and functionality. 
- By using this we can perform operations such as addition, updation, deletion, and accessing of data

### `Disadvantages of using File System`:

1. `Data Redundancy and Inconsistency`: Storing the same data in multiple locations leads to unnecessary duplication, and if updates are made to only one instance, inconsistencies arise.
2. `Difficulty in Accessing Data`: Retrieving specific data can be complex and inefficient due to the lack of structured queries.
3. `Data Isolation`: Related data stored in different files or locations is challenging to access and retrieve.
4. `Isolation Problem`: Ensuring the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data across isolated files is difficult.
5. `Atomicity Problem`: Incomplete operations can lead to partial updates, leaving data in an inconsistent state.
6. `Concurrent Access Anomalies`: Simultaneous access or modifications by multiple users can result in conflicts and data corruption.
7. `Security Problem`: File systems lack advanced security measures, making it harder to control access and protect sensitive information.
