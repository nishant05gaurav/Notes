## Data Structures and Algorithm

### Introduction

#### Data Structures:
- Data structures are fundamental building blocks in which data are arranged so that data items can be used efficiently in memory
- Examples: Array, Stack, Linked List, etc

#### Algorithm:
- Sequence of steps on data using efficient data structures to solve a given problem
- Examples: sorting an array.

#### Other Terminology:

1. `Database` - Collection of information in permanent storage for faster retrieval and updation. Examples- MySql, MongoDB, etc.
2. `Data Warehouse` - Management of huge data of legacy data( the data we keep at a different place from our fresh data in the database to make the process of retrieval and updation fast) for better analysis.
3. `Big Data` - Analysis of too large or complex data, which cannot be dealt with the traditional data processing applications.
